Train schedule page

This page was created to learn how to use googles Firebase as a means of storing real time data. In addition, moment.js was also introduced and incorporated into this page to display current time and calculate when the next train would arrive given data documenting it's frequency and initial departure. The first table displays information like train name, train destination, frequency, time of next arrival, and minutes until next arrival. In the second table, a user can input unique information for their own train and push the data into the firebase database which will result in the first table being updated.
